Dependency management with modules is the recommended approach for managing dependencies in Go projects starting from Go version 1.11. Modules provide a way to define and manage the dependencies of your Go project, ensuring reproducibility and versioning control. Here's an overview of using modules for dependency management:

1. Initialize Go Modules:
   - To start using modules in your project, navigate to the root directory of your project in the terminal.
   - Initialize Go modules using the following command:

```bash
go mod init <module-name>
```

   - This creates a `go.mod` file in the root directory, which serves as the manifest for your project's dependencies.

2. Add Dependencies:
   - To add a new dependency to your project, use the `go get` command followed by the package name:

```bash
go get <package-name>
```

   - The `go get` command fetches the specified package and its dependencies, updating the `go.mod` and `go.sum` files accordingly.

3. Versioning:
   - Go modules use semantic versioning (semver) for managing package versions.
   - You can specify the desired version of a dependency by appending `@<version>` to the package name in the `go get` command.

4. Update Dependencies:
   - To update dependencies in your project to the latest available versions, use the `go get` command with the `-u` flag:

```bash
go get -u <package-name>
```

   - This command updates the specified package and its dependencies to their latest versions.

5. Vendor Directory:
   - Go modules automatically manage dependencies in a directory called `vendor/`.
   - The `vendor/` directory contains copies of all the direct dependencies of your project.
   - To create or update the `vendor/` directory, use the following command:

```bash
go mod vendor
```

   - This command copies the dependencies into the `vendor/` directory, allowing you to build your project without relying on external sources.

6. Build and Run:
   - Once you have defined your dependencies in the `go.mod` file, you can build and run your project as usual with the `go build` and `go run` commands.
   - Go automatically resolves and fetches the required dependencies based on the information in the `go.mod` file.

Go modules provide a standardized and efficient way to manage dependencies in Go projects. They ensure reproducibility, version control, and easy dependency tracking. By using modules, you can easily add, update, and remove dependencies in your project, simplifying the management of external code dependencies and improving the overall development experience.
