In Go, the `context` package provides a way to manage and propagate cancellation signals across goroutines. It is designed to help with graceful termination and handling of long-running operations. Here's an overview of using `context` and cancellation in Go:

1. Context:
   - The `context.Context` type represents a context for a specific operation or request.
   - A context carries deadlines, cancellation signals, and other request-scoped values across API boundaries.
   - Use the `context.Background()` function to create a root context. It serves as the parent for all other contexts.
   - Create derived contexts using `context.WithCancel()`, `context.WithDeadline()`, or `context.WithTimeout()` functions.
   - Derived contexts inherit the values and cancellation signals from their parent contexts.

   Example:
   ```go
   package main

   import (
       "context"
       "fmt"
       "time"
   )

   func main() {
       // Create a root context
       ctx := context.Background()

       // Create a derived context with cancellation
       ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(ctx)

       // Start a goroutine that performs some operation
       go doSomeOperation(ctx)

       // Cancel the context after 2 seconds
       time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
       cancel()

       // Wait for the goroutine to complete
       time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
   }

   func doSomeOperation(ctx context.Context) {
       for {
           select {
           case <-ctx.Done():
               fmt.Println("Operation cancelled")
               return
           default:
               // Perform some work
               fmt.Println("Performing work...")
               time.Sleep(500 * time.Millisecond)
           }
       }
   }
   ```

2. Cancellation:
   - Cancellation in Go is achieved by calling the `cancel()` function returned by `context.WithCancel()` or `context.WithTimeout()`.
   - When a context is canceled, all the child contexts and goroutines created from it are also canceled.
   - Cancellation is propagated through the context's `Done()` channel. Reading from this channel signals that the context is canceled.

3. Deadline and Timeout:
   - Besides cancellation, you can use a context to set a deadline or timeout for an operation.
   - Use `context.WithDeadline()` to create a context with an absolute deadline time.
   - Use `context.WithTimeout()` to create a context with a relative timeout duration.
   - When the deadline or timeout is reached, the context is automatically canceled.

   Example:
   ```go
   package main

   import (
       "context"
       "fmt"
       "time"
   )

   func main() {
       ctx := context.Background()

       // Create a derived context with a deadline
       ctx, cancel := context.WithDeadline(ctx, time.Now().Add(2*time.Second))
       defer cancel()

       // Start a goroutine that performs some operation
       go doSomeOperation(ctx)

       // Wait for the goroutine to complete
       time.Sleep(3 * time.Second)
   }

   func doSomeOperation(ctx context.Context) {
       for {
           select {
           case <-ctx.Done():
               fmt.Println("Operation cancelled")
               return
           default:
               // Perform some work
               fmt.Println("Performing work...")
               time.Sleep(500 * time.Millisecond)
           }
       }
   }
   ```

Using `context` and cancellation signals in Go helps with managing long-running operations, graceful termination, and preventing resource leaks. It allows for better control and coordination between goroutines. By propagating cancellation signals through contexts, you can create robust and responsive concurrent applications.
