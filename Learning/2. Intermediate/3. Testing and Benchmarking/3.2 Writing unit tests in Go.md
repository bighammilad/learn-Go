Writing unit tests in Go involves using the built-in testing package, `testing`, to create test functions and assertions. Here's an overview of how to write unit tests in Go:

1. Test Function Structure:
   - Write a test function for each unit of code you want to test.
   - Test functions should have a name starting with `Test` and take a single parameter of type `*testing.T`.
   - Here's an example of a test function:
     ```go
     func TestAdd(t *testing.T) {
         // Test code goes here
     }
     ```

2. Assertions and Error Reporting:
   - Use the methods provided by `*testing.T` to perform assertions and report test failures.
   - `t.Errorf(format, args...)` reports a test failure with an error message.
   - `t.Fatalf(format, args...)` reports a test failure and stops the test execution immediately.
   - `t.Log(args...)` logs additional information during the test execution.

3. Test Cases and Subtests:
   - Use subtests to organize multiple test cases within a test function.
   - Subtests can be created using the `t.Run(name, func)` method.
   - The `name` parameter provides a descriptive name for the subtest.
   - Here's an example of using subtests:
     ```go
     func TestAdd(t *testing.T) {
         testCases := []struct {
             a, b, expected int
         }{
             {2, 3, 5},
             {-1, 1, 0},
             {0, 0, 0},
         }
         for _, tc := range testCases {
             t.Run(fmt.Sprintf("%d + %d", tc.a, tc.b), func(t *testing.T) {
                 result := Add(tc.a, tc.b)
                 if result != tc.expected {
                     t.Errorf("unexpected result: got %d, expected %d", result, tc.expected)
                 }
             })
         }
     }
     ```

4. Running Tests:
   - Tests can be run using the `go test` command in the terminal.
   - By default, `go test` runs all the tests in the current directory and its subdirectories.
   - Use the `-run` flag with a regular expression to run specific tests.
   - Use the `-v` flag for verbose output, displaying the name of each test function being run.
   - Here's an example of running tests:
     ```
     $ go test
     ```

5. Assertions and Helper Functions:
   - You can create helper functions or utilities to assist in writing assertions or common test operations.
   - These helper functions should follow regular Go function naming conventions and take `*testing.T` as a parameter.
   - Helper functions can be used within test functions to improve readability and maintainability.

When writing unit tests, aim to cover different code paths, edge cases, and potential failure scenarios. Provide meaningful error messages when test failures occur to aid in debugging. Utilize subtests to organize and group related test cases. Regularly run tests to ensure the correctness and stability of your codebase.
